# TASK1_VSD_SURAJ

Instructor : Kunal Ghosh 

# Task-2:
* Refer to C-program based lab and RISCV based lab.<br/>
* Execute both the tasks in the terminal window.<br/>
*Compilers use are GCC and Risc GCC compiler.<br/>
### Using C programming:
->Make sure you are in the home directory<br/>

->We can see the assembly main code from which location it starts<br/>

->Enter the command gcc sum1ton.c<br/>
->To check the output run command ./a.out<br/>

<br/>

->Using Debugger d in spike to debug some locations of assembly code<br/>
->Actually here we see the initial value stack is having same value after lui instrunction<br/>
->C-Progrram compile using RISC-V gcc and run using spike<br/>

->Finally we can use the same debugger to check all other locations 

# TASK-3:
* Refer to the RISC-V software documentation and list various RISC-V Instruction code<br/>
* 32 bit instruction format for 15 unique instruction codes from objdump file<br/>

#Instruction Format for RISC-V 32-BIT Instruction code:<br/>

#There are 6 types of instruction for Immediate encoding variables <br/>
- R-Type Instruction -Register
- I-Type Instruction- Immediate
- S-Type Instruction-Store
- B-Type Instruction-Branch 
- u-Type Instruction-Upper Immediate
- J-Type Instruction-Jump
